## Importance of statistics in each Machine Learning Stage

Problem Framing: Requires the use of exploratory data analysis and data mining.
Data Understanding: Requires the use of summary statistics and data visualization.
Data Cleaning: Requires the use of outlier detection, imputation and more.
Data Selection: Requires the use of data sampling and feature selection methods.
Data Preparation: Requires the use of data transforms, scaling, encoding and much more.
Model Evaluation: Requires experimental design and resampling methods.
Model Configuration: Requires the use of statistical hypothesis tests and estimation statistics.
Model Selection: Requires the use of statistical hypothesis tests and estimation statistics.
Model Presentation: Requires the use of estimation statistics such as confidence intervals.
Model Predictions: Requires the use of estimation statistics such as prediction intervals.
